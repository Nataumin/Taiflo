Once down, no easy going up. People struggle to go up. They try. They're obsessed with ups. They dream of ups. They imagine an uppest. Call it _Heaven._ Awayest from their life. Because life hurts.

Life hurts the most around the streets. Upper from there is better off. But coming up here doesn't give me any more of the heavenly shine, if any, because Sun's yet too far for the reach to mean anything. It gets colder before any warmth of the shine. Winds still whip, and my eyes water a little. I sweep my hair out of face and sip the not-my cup of tea that's losing heat.
