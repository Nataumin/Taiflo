I'm not going to get much of a free tour around, so I make the most of the view I've got on this balcony. Not that I like what I see, but none else better is around.
Could I live here, in this city? Or another. Many options. My future location. For an independent life. Not soon. They won't let me go any time soon. Someday. A few years ahead, when I'll have reached the age.
It doesn’t have to be city. May be countryside. I’ve been to many. Closer to nature. Nice. Would’ve been much nicer if by myself. Always ruined. By them. But without their calls in the first place I couldn’t have been there. There, I’m two-fold: enjoying the nature, and enduring the people.
