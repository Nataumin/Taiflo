I glance at the sky. . . . . . . Empty. . . . . . . Is it? . . . . . . . Particles. . . . Countless. . . . Disintegrated bits of things. . . . Of the planet. . . . From all times, I think. . . . Drifting in the air, without a memory. . . . Might be even bits from the time of dinosaurs. . . . And among them, maybe a little mouse, who saw the terrible asteroid crashing in. Her world breaking up, she spurted out, but got cornered to a cliff, so jumped off it, and, right there, the hellish tsunami of fire caught her, incinerating her, to ashes. Specks of her, ever since the disaster, might've been floating high up there somehow, until it lost all its ties to her self, and descending, onto the surface that's now awfully unrecognisable, like a different planet. The world of humans. Tangling and rotting, like a sick gut, swallowing everything, shitting everywhere.
