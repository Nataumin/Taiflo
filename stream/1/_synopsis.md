She has been living in Moscow, poorly, then affluently, with frequent “trips” abroad, for nine years, since her memory loss. “Varya, 15”, as her fake passport and fake parents call her, wants to go to school, but cannot. From the first-rate apartment all to herself, she studies alone, observing the failing world. After a night, she receives a letter, written by a man claiming to have been her former custodian. He recounts of her forgotten past. It does not convince her. Up to her is to see for herself what would be the only proof of this other-worldly tale. This means to leave the country, without telling the two adults. She needs her passport, and it is locked away from her, by them.
